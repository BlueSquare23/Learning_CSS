CSS is a language for describing the look and formatting of content. Usually this content is in 
the form of HTML however it is possible to be in other formats as well. CSS is organised as a set 
of rules that define how different parts of the content should be presented. The actual code 
looks like this:

selector{
  property:value;
  property:value;
}

* The selector identifies which parts of the content the rules should apply to. The rules that 
are inside the opening and closing curly brackets ( { } ) are applied to any items matching the 
selector.

* A property is an aspect of the presentation we would like to set.

* The value is how we would like the property to behave.

* A semicolon is included at the end of each property, value pair to separate it from the next 
pair.


Let's have a quick look at an example of how this works. We'll discuss the properties in this 
example in a later section:

* CSS

/*This is a comment in CSS*/
h1 {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: #4583c2;
}

p {
  padding-left: 20px;
  font-size: 18px;
}


* HTML
<body>
  <h1>Unicycling</h1>
  
  <p>It takes twice the man to ride with half the wheels.</p>
</body>
